# Weekend Challenge 1: JQuery Salary Calculator

## Description

This project is an application that will take inputs from the user _employee first name, last name, ID number, job title, annual salary_.

A button will collect the information from the users inputs, store the information to calculate monthly costs, append information to the DOM and clear the input fields. Using this information we will calculate monthly costs to pay employees salaries and append that value to the DOM as well. If the monthly costs exceed $20,000 it will add a red background color to the total monthly cost. 

The information will be organized in a table that will also contain a delete row button at the end of each row. At this time deleting a row does not adjust the total monthly cost element. But everything else has its function working!

## Usage    

1. Load the page
2. Input information in the field
3. Press submit and information will be displayed on DOM
4. Pressing 'Delete' button will remove the table row that the button is in. 

## Built With

- Javascript & JQuery
- HTML
- CSS
