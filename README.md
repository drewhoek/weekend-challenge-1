# Weekend Challenge 1: JQuery Salary Calculator

## Description

This project is an application that will take inputs from the user _employee first name, last name, ID number, job title, annual salary_.

A button will collect the information from the users inputs, store the information to calculate monthly costs, append information to the DOM and clear the input fields. Using this information we will calculate monthly costs to pay employees salaries and append that value to the DOM as well. If the monthly costs exceed $20,000 it will add a red background color to the total monthly cost.
